  Code to generate all computational Figures in Jayawant *et al.* as interactive Jupyter notebooks.
  <br>
</h1>

`Manifest.toml` and `Project.toml` contain the packages and their versions used to do all modeling in this paper. The below details will tell you which sheet will recreate each figure. All model definition files, and analysis is performed in these sheets.

## Recreating Figures

* increasedcRel_RelA_models.ipynb
  - ![Figure 1 Example](/Images/Figure1Example.png)
  - Will generate the simulations with increased cRel, RelA and RelB from Figure 1C and 1D.
* cellLineModelsFromGeneExpression.ipynb
  - ![Figure 2 Example](/Images/Figure2Example.png)
  - Will generate figure 1A and all panels of Figure 2.
* generateModelFingerprints.ipynb
  - ![Figure 4 Example](/Images/Figure4Example.png)
  - Will generate the Fingerprints for all modelled cell lines, as seen in Figure 4 and S1.
* cytokineGeneExpression.ipynb
  - ![Figure 4 Example](/Images/supplementalFigExample.png)
  - Will generate the cytokine expression data bar graphs for the supplemental figure.
* Figure5/Cell Line Model and fingerprinting.ipynb
  - ![Figure 5 Example](/Images/Figure5Example.png)
  - Will generate the cell line models with and without mutations as seen in Figure 5.
