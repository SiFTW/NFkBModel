## Recreating Figures

* increasedcRel_RelA_models.ipynb
  - ![Figure 1 Example](/Images/Figure1Example.png)
  - Will generate the simulations with increased cRel, RelA and RelB from Figure 1C and 1D.
* cellLineModelsFromGeneExpression.ipynb
  - ![Figure 2 Example](/Images/Figure2Example.png)
  - Will generate figure 1A and all panels of Figure 2.
* generateModelFingerprints.ipynb
  - ![Figure 4 Example](/Images/Figure4Example.png)
  - Will generate the Fingerprints for all modelled cell lines, as seen in Figure 4 and S1.
* cytokineGeneExpression.ipynb
  - ![Figure 4 Example](/Images/supplementalFigExample.png)
  - Will generate the cytokine expression data bar graphs for the supplemental figure.
* Figure5/Cell Line Model and fingerprinting.ipynb
  - ![Figure 5 Example](/Images/Figure5Example.png)
  - Will generate the cell line models with and without mutations as seen in Figure 5.
